The only things that should be blocking are security and quality of service changes.

What we are looking for is the approval, not the code review.

Good point (and what we don't have) - automatic follow-up on commits.

Formalize rules:
 - What is the definition of an inexperienced developer?
 - Which parts of the system are critical

Point: feedback loop

Introduce the tool progressively - in the beginning it can just be labels.
